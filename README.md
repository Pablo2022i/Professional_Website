# Professional_Website

## About the Project
We will work as a group for this CS220-01 project by creating a professional website for a real company called "Kolobeat", which is a music and lighting company for weddings or social parties. Each one of us will be focusing on a different html page for the navigation bar, which we will discuss in chat.  
The group members are:
Nelly Fuerte,
Pablo Chavez,

4. You should be able to see this screen on GitHub Desktop. Now, click on "current branch" and then click on "new branch"; this will let you make changes in your local branch and then merge it into the actual project.

7. <strong>IMPORTANT</strong><br>
Follow this step every time before starting to code!
To pull all the code from the main file into your local branch, the one that you created (main is the source code, and we will merge all our work into this file to finish the project), use this in your terminal: <strong>git pull origin main</strong>. If that does not work (which won't happen), try this:

git checkout main —-> move from the current branch to main

git pull origin main —-> take the latest content from main

git checkout *###*(your local branch) —-> move from master to your current branch

git merge main —-> merging the latest content of main into your branch
